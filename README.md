# sbws
Safebrowsing web server (in development)

The goal is the have a local web server that can be called by a SIEM as a workflow process, which would then call the sbserver to get an opinion on a URL being researched by a security analyst.  Need to add a call to sbserver that will return Safe Browsing lookup result.
